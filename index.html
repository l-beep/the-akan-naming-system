    <h1>The Akan Naming System</h1>
    <p>In West Africa, newborns are given special names depending on the day they are born. Diverse ethnicities have
        variants and meanings as a symbol of cultural integrity and ancestral affiliation. Here’s your need-to-know
        guide</p><br><br><br>

    <h1>The System</h1>
    <p>The Akan people use the Kwa language group’s system of timekeeping, which is based on a six-day week (‘nnanson‘),
        with the seventh day inclusive. In Ashanti homes, Sunday-born males and females are named Kwasi or Kwesi and
        Akosua respectively (meaning ‘associated with the universe’); Monday-born are Kwadwo or Kojo, Adjoa or Adwoa
        (meaning ‘associated with peace’); Tuesday-born are Kwabena or Kobi, Abena (meaning ‘associated with the
        ocean’); Wednesday-born Kwaku or Kweku, Akua (meaning ‘associated with spider/Ananse’); Thursday-born Yaw, Yaa (
        meaning ‘associated with the earth’); Friday-born Kofi, Afia or Afua (meaning ‘associated with fertility’); and
        Saturday-born Kwame, Ama (meaning ‘associated with God’).</p>
    <p>Fanti boys and girls, on the other hand, are given the day names: Monday – Cudjoe, Kojo, Quajo, Adjoa, Ajuba,
        Juba; Tuesday – Quabena, Abena, Bena; Wednesday – Quaco, Aqua, Acooba, Cooba; Thursday – Quaw, Aba, Yaaba;
        Friday – Cuffy, Afiba, Fiba; Saturday – Quame, Quamina, Ama; and Sunday – Quashie, Quasheba.</p>
    <p>History also plays a part. Slaves from the Gold Coast taken to the Caribbean during the 18th and 19th centuries
        were referred to as Coromantees. As such, the Ndyuka people and parents in Jamaica give their children the
        following day names: Monday – Cudjoe, Kodyo, Adyuba; Tuesday – Cubbenah, Abeni; Wednesday – Quaco, Kwaku, Akuba;
        Thursday – Quao, Yaw, Yaba; Friday – Cuffee, Kofi, Afiba; Saturday – Quamin, Kwami, Amba; and Sunday – Quashee,
        Kwasi, Kwasiba.</p>
